# Satellite suite: the ISL grid

**Regime:** satellite / inter-satellite-link mesh — the second of the two
regimes this project measures. The MANET suite (the original) lives under
[`scenarios/`](../../benchmarks.md); why the two regimes are different enough
to need separate suites is [`network-regimes.md`](../../network-regimes.md).

## What this suite is, and is not

One harness, [`ns3/examples/isl-grid.cc`](../../../ns3/examples/isl-grid.cc):
an R×C **+Grid torus** of point-to-point ISLs — one `/30` subnet per link, so
every satellite holds one interface *per neighbour* (degree 4 on the torus).
That multi-interface shape is the point: it is what the MANET suite can never
exercise, and it is what #203 broke on before [#224](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/pull/224)
fixed next-hop resolution per interface. Metrics mirror `anthocnet-compare`'s
definitions at the same IP-layer counting point, so a number here is comparable
in *kind* (never in regime) to a MANET number.

It is a **static snapshot** grid: no orbital mechanics, no GSL handover, no
link churn. That makes it the quiet-cell instrument — the regime where the
[#216](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/216) precomputed
shortest-path control is expected to win and AntHocNet is expected to lose.
Of the adversarial cells that could show the opposite (unpredicted ISL loss,
asymmetric congestion, handover churn), only the **first has an instrument**:
[#260](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/260) added a scripted
single-ISL break (`--breakLink=r1,c1,r2,c2 --breakAt=<s>`, cut via
`Ipv4::SetDown` on both endpoint interfaces) that reports a per-run
`# failcell … tDetect=<s> tReconverge=<s>` line. The remaining cells are
#216's scope and do not exist yet; until the #216 control row exists, results
from this page — failcell lines included — support harness-validation claims,
not protocol-advantage claims.

**Read the failcell numbers honestly.** `tDetect` (break → the protocol's
first neighbour-loss event for the severed peer, from the `RouteChanged`
trace; AntHocNet only — the baselines expose no such trace) is ~0 *by
construction* for a scripted break: the adapter's #260 fast path is the
`Ipv4` interface-down notification itself, the only failure signal a
`PointToPointNetDevice` offers (no retry-limit trace; IP drops packets to a
down interface before any device trace can fire). That models an ISL terminal
reporting loss-of-light locally within ms. A *silent* failure — the interface
stays up but frames stop arriving (e.g. a receive-side error model) — is not
covered by the fast path and still waits the full hello timeout,
`helloInterval × allowedHelloLoss` = 2 s at defaults; a failure cell built on
silent loss lower-bounds the protocol, exactly the pre-#260 caveat.
`tReconverge` (break → the last of the per-flow first deliveries after the
break) is a **proxy**: the harness does not know which flows crossed the
broken ISL, so unaffected flows contribute ~one CBR inter-packet gap
(~125 ms at the 64 B / 4096 bps defaults) and only a value clearly above that
gap measures re-convergence.

## Configuration

| knob | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `rows` × `cols` | 4 × 4 | orbital planes × satellites per plane |
| `torus` | true | wrap the edges (+Grid); false = open grid |
| `islDelayMs` | 5 | one-way ISL propagation delay (LEO ISLs are ~3–13 ms) |
| `islRate` | 10Mbps | ISL data rate |
| `flows` / `cbrBps` | 8 / 4096 | CBR load |
| `protocols` | anthocnet,aodv,olsr,dsdv | `anthocnet,aodv` is the [#250](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/250) hop-delay discriminator pair |
| `breakLink` / `breakAt` | off | [#260](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/260) scripted single-ISL break: endpoints `r1,c1,r2,c2` + cut time (s); emits `# failcell` detect/reconverge lines |

## How to run it

- **Dispatch** the manual **Satellite benchmark** workflow
  (`satellite-benchmark.yml`) — the regime's counterpart of the MANET
  `paper-benchmark.yml`. Same contract: results file + `time -v` artifact, a
  compact tail block cheap to fetch from the job log, `extraArgs` for ns-3
  attribute overrides (e.g.
  `--ns3::anthocnet::RoutingProtocol::EnableDirectedReactive=true` for the
  [#244](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/244) satellite arm).
- **Locally**, with an ns-3 tree carrying the module:
  `./ns3 run "isl-grid --rows=4 --cols=4 --runs=3 --protocols=anthocnet,aodv"`.

## Validation gates (run on every PR, 3.42 CI leg)

The satellite suite's anchors are **analytic**, and therefore stricter than
the MANET suite's literature-derived ones
([methodology](../methodology.md#validation-anchors-known-expected-results)):
a point-to-point grid with fixed per-link delay has no stochastic channel, so

- **single-isl**: delivery over one ISL must be ≥ `sat_single_isl_pdr_min`
  (99.0 — physics says 100);
- **hop-delay**: mean delay must sit within `sat_hop_delay_slack_ms` (1.5 ms)
  of the analytic floor `hops × islDelayMs`;
- **determinism**: the same seed twice must be byte-identical
  (`check-determinism.sh … isl-grid`).

Values live in [`ns3/tools/anchors.yml`](../../../ns3/tools/anchors.yml);
the gate is [`ns3/tools/check-sat-anchors.sh`](../../../ns3/tools/check-sat-anchors.sh)
(#237/#238). Known open question against the hop-delay floor: the ~0.25 ms
excess tracked in [#250](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/250)
— inside the slack, not yet attributed.

## Results

**No committed results yet**, but the pipeline that lands and gates them is
real ([#259](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/259)) — the same
dispatch → rescue → validate → parse loop the MANET suite runs, so no
satellite number is ever eyeball-only:

1. **Dispatch** `satellite-benchmark.yml` (above). The results file
   (`satellite-results.txt`: `##RUN##` per-seed rows plus the summary table)
   is uploaded as the `satellite-benchmark` artifact (30-day retention).
2. **Rescue** it past expiry with the `rescue-artifacts` workflow
   (`sat_run_ids` input); it is committed as
   `docs/benchmarks/campaign/<runid>-sat.txt`.
3. **Validate** before reading:
   `python3 .claude/skills/benchmark-results/scenario_check.py results FILE`
   understands both the `--csv` schema and the human
   `##RUN##`/table output, runs the generic plausibility rules (PDR bounds,
   delay99 ≥ mean, negatives, dead cells) and adds the satellite invariants —
   mean delay at or above the one-ISL propagation floor (`isl_delay_ms`), and
   the `sat_single_isl_pdr_min` floor from
   [`ns3/tools/anchors.yml`](../../../ns3/tools/anchors.yml) on any AODV row
   whose topology is the 2-node/1-link anchor. A FAIL is a harness bug: do
   not compare, publish, or quote the numbers.
4. **Parse / A/B** with
   `python3 .claude/skills/benchmark-results/bench_parse.py OFF ON` — both
   the text output and `--csv` rows are accepted; the
   [#244](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/244) directed-arm
   and [#250](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/250) comparisons
   are exactly this. Record the verdict + run IDs on the driving issue
   (ADR-0013).

This suite has no per-merge refresh (the MANET quick taxonomy keeps that
job). Do not quote the CI smoke numbers — they are delivery gates at tiny
scale, not measurements.

What the suite is waiting on, in dependency order:

1. [#216](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/216) — the
   precomputed-shortest-path control row and the satellite scenario class in
   the taxonomy (with the adversarial cells). **The control is what makes a
   satellite result a result.**
2. [#206](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/206) — per-next-hop
   congestion signal, precondition for the congestion cell.
3. [#244](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/244) /
   [#245](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/245) — the directed
   reactive A/B and its open steering hazard.
4. The strategy frame for reading any of it:
   [#192 analysis](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/issues/192)
   (detect+reconverge race, path-stretch cost, bootstrap uniformity).
